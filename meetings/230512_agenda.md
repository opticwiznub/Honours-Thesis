# Friday 12th May Meeting

## Meeting Time: 3pm

## Location: Inperson

# Attendees:

- Yanan Fan
- Justin Clarke

# Agenda:

- Getting the actual historical temperatures online somewhere
  - Scale doesnt match up
  - We could also treat one model as the truth 
    - Try find historical first, see if you can interpolate the truth on the grid points we want
    - If having trouble with mapping the model grid points to the historical ones, ask Max or Nandini
- Models would have been trained on the historical

# Goals for next week

- Try start making a GNN with next timestep's as the Y
- While the model is running, explore the historical, figure out how to use the climate explorer
  - Since model takes a lot of time to run

# Previous Meeting Updates

- Data Issue (Historical is not uniform across all datasets i.e there is no truth)
- Are we interested in testing the results / prediction?
- Check from 1960's onwards
  - Plot the temperature from all the models we have and they should all be quite similar
