# Tuesday 24th October Meeting

## Meeting Time: 2pm

## Location: Online

# Attendees:

- Yanan Fan
- Justin Clarke

# Agenda:

- Managed to get edge weights into an adjacency matrix
  - LTH iteratively removes the smallest 5% but these are just values < 1e4
  - How to interpret these edge weights?
- Found a different way to process the data in xarray which is better and faster

  - Float the idea of just using a yearly average of each model instead of monthly 1960 - 1980?

- Resources to write about how an individual model of CMIP6 is trained etc? I would like to describe a bit about how one model works.
