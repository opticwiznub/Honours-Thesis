# Friday 28th April Meeting

## Meeting Time: 3pm

## Location: Inperson

# Attendees:

- Yanan Fan
- Justin Clarke

# Agenda:

- Options
  - For each model, stack all the values into a single column and have the x matrix as a matrix of all models
    - This gives you an overall dependence
  - For each model and variable, have a node representing it. 
    - Within each variable, have a fully connected subgraph 
      - We could also fully connect all combinations of models and variable (could be messy) option 3
- For grids, stack the time series and grid points into a single vector (flatten)

# Goals for next week

- Check historical data see if we have the truth or different model stuffs for the Y value (see if we have the truth already)
- Have a go at creating some of the vectors for the neural network
- Have a go at making a first iteration of the GNN

# Previous Meeting Updates

- Data update
  - Plotting around the shape of Australia for filtering
  - Bounding box is ok but you probably need to plot the australia boundaries on it as well
  - Experiment with plot, visualise the summer period with extremities
    - Models will be predicting different things and so theres more visually appealing stuff

- Draw the network and what each part of the formula is
- What are each of the values that go into each of the columns X and come out as Y
  - What do we want as an output? Actual data?
- Check historical data all lines up because we dont want previous dates data being affected by the scenario between different models
- Check the maths and maybe read 'Probabilistic Machine Learning' by Kevin Murphy (not the advanced one)
