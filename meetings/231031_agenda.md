# Tuesday 24th October Meeting

## Meeting Time: 2pm

## Location: Online

# Attendees:

- Yanan Fan
- Justin Clarke

# Agenda:

- How to cite the dataset im using?
  - List of all the model names
  -

# Goals for next week

- Make a visualisation of an actual graph between the sparse edge weight values and partial correlation matrix

  - Will the edge weights follow some ratio or distribution with partial correlation
  - Try some different sets of values
  - Maybe write some code to randomly pick some nodes and plot them all

- Ask chatgpt for a visualisation of the adjacency?
- Look around for other details in the edge_weight parameter like variance etc. because the weight should be a normal distribution.
- Put a historical line into the graphs
- Find some way to visualise the difference in correlation heatmap and dependence in the edge_weight
- Start with a small group of nodes to plot and visualise 3-way interactions instead of just 2 way
- Test out yearly but keeping spatial information
  - That might be a different dependence
- Talk a bit more about model training time 3 days for 5 model years etc.
  - Shows a bit about dependence but theyre all trying to
  - They can be considered realisations of the truth but theyre not independent realisation
  - CMIP is like solving navier-stokes equations etc.
