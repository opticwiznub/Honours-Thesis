# Friday 24th March Meeting

## Meeting Time: 3pm

## Location: Online (Teams)

# Attendees:

- Yanan Fan
- Justin Clarke
- Nandini Ramesh

# Agenda:

- Figure out how to use climate explorer website (https://climexp.knmi.nl/start.cgi)
- What data and which models to use
- Do we really care about how different models are?
  - Where models differ in their predictions, jetstreams change? Max winds? Spatially complex
  - With el nino, events have different predictions
  - Constrain the phenomena

# Goals for next week

- Download 1 scenario from each models for each variable
- Get added to NCI 
  - We dont want a hell of a lot of data
  - 100k data points max to test this concept
  - Start with just one of these variables as a test (TAS and PSL)
  - Download monthly averages of temperature and go at the scale of Australia
  - 
- CMIP is on GCP if we need more resources


# Previous Meeting Updates

- CMIP6 Data
  - Look at somewhere youre interested
  - Start with something simply
  - Take data over several grids and maybe average from there
  - 5 or 10 grid points (start with daily for now)
  - Start by getting it and formatting it (then plot)
- Xiongwen's Paper (4.2.2)
  - Figure out whether their algorithm is targeting an output and how is it trained
  - We dont know the true connections
  - Do we need to put the true observation as a node to train it on
- Get some code and data up and running
- Read through Xiongwens paper again
- Get a meeting with Climate friend to meet and figure out what all the data and website means
- What do nodes represent?
  - Model output
  - Or actual observations
  - How do we setup the NN and how do we structure it? Where does data go in etc.
