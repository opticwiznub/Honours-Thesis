# Friday 14th April Meeting

## Meeting Time: 3pm

## Location: Online (Teams)

# Attendees:

- Yanan Fan
- Justin Clarke

# Agenda:

- Data update
  - Plotting around the shape of Australia for filtering
  - Bounding box is ok but you probably need to plot the australia boundaries on it as well
  - Experiment with plot, visualise the summer period with extremities
    - Models will be predicting different things and so theres more visually appealing stuff

# Goals for next week

- Draw the network and what each part of the formula is
- What are each of the values that go into each of the columns X and come out as Y
  - What do we want as an output? Actual data?
- Check historical data all lines up because we dont want previous dates data being affected by the scenario between different models
- Check the maths and maybe read 'Probabilistic Machine Learning' by Kevin Murphy (not the advanced one)

# Previous Meeting Updates

- Go back to the paper and really understand the structure of the model
  - Write down the maths and understand all of it
  - Enough to be able to present on it
  - Conceptual understanding vs understanding the math
  - Thesis chapter vs the paper
- Look through the references to see if its any better
- Make data weekly
- 1950 -> 2100 year of data
- Time series of all 40 models to make sure stuff is correct
- Filter grid points to just Australia or something
