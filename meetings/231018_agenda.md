# Agenda:

- Weird graphs for EDA section
- Data quality is pretty bad, I think I have some problems with the data I downloaded
  - OR i havent joined it correctly? need to investigate
  - Remove those specific models or have a look into how data is processed

# Goals for next week

- Try some boxplots / violin plots for EDA section
- Maybe pick out a couple models and pick a smaller section of time and area

  - We have precipitation as well to plot
  - Use a two models with higher levels of correlation to compare
  - This is more of an info sharing section

- Reshape the edge_weight matrix into the size of the adjacency matrix and see which edges are connected to which nodes

# Previous Meeting Updates

- Introduction

  - Mostly written up with much more references from papers I've read
  -

- Chapter 3 (climate models + dataset + plots of dataset)

  - Struggling with EDA a bit

- Check the edge weights again from xiongwens code
