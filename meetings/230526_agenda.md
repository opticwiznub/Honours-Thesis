# Goals for next week

# Previous Meeting Updates

- Currently using 1 ACCESS-CM2 as the truth right now
- Gotten Xiongwen's code working on my machine
- Is there some way of putting mean to the message passing framework / manipulate it with the prior

  - Can we refine it to make it a measure of correlation / distance to two nodes

- Get Xiongwen's code for GNNs and try get GNNs running
- Visualise a smaller number of models with GNNs (around 10)
  - Write down / comment what I've found and been doing
- Read a bit more, try become a bit more of an expert on GNNs and come up with some of your own ideas
  - Read a bit on message passing
