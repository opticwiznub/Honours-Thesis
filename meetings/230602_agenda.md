## Meeting Time: 3pm

## Location: Online (Teams)

# Attendees:

- Yanan Fan
- Justin Clarke

# Agenda:

- Useful reading
  - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.01212.pdf (Original Message passing paper)
  - https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/introduction.html, https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/create_gnn.html (GNN in python code tutorial)
- GNN Code
  - Most of the code I've seen online is about node classification, how do I change it to regression?
  - I understand a lot of the code framework, the GNN_structure.ipynb file has a lot of commented code explaining what each section does
- Data Processing
  - Climate data needs to be formatted into a torch tensor to be used with PYG, this is still in progress
- Is the date feature important?

# Goals for next week

- Mathematically write down what I know about the mathematical formation of the model
- Have a look at the basic probabilistic machine learning book
- Get the code working for next week
- Try get Khanh's thesis to read

# Previous Meeting Updates

- Have a think about the form of the mask, look at creating
- Write down what I know and what I don't know about
  - Describe what the setup / problem is, how the model is setup, what the adjacentcy matrix looks etc.
  - Once you get the results, what can you say from the results
  - Jupyter notebook with the code
- Write down a summary of graph neural networks with as much detail as possible and fill it up as we go
- Work through Cora example
