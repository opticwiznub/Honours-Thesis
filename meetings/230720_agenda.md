# Friday 20th July Meeting

## Meeting Time: 3pm

## Location: Online

# Attendees:

- Yanan Fan
- Justin Clarke

# Agenda:

- Data error on a few models 8, 9
  - Suspect its something to do with the dates, most models have have the same grid but the dates might be different
- Data is now monthly on just Australia so there are only ~70k records
- Getting some results, none are 0 with Xiongens code but some get close
  - 100 epochs doesnt get anything but 1000 gets some close to zero
- Trying to use bibtex for referencing but having some issues (sorted)
  - Do you have any experience with this?
- Bit confused by matrix normalisation or \tilda{D} and \tilda{A}

# Goals for next week

- Try a lot more epochs
  - Learning rates, ask Xiongwen how he set his hyperparams?
- Plot a time series of X
- Plot a single grid point, and send to yanan email
  - Idea is to get the data in some sort of cluster than you can see that in a plot
- 4000 epochs is roughly what you need
  - split into test and train and see if loss holds up
