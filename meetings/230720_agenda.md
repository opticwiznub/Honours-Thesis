# Previous Meeting Updates

- Go through writing
  - Reccommendations for climate literature to fill out introduction sections etc?
  - Ideas for structure? I'm not sure how a honours thesis should be structured
    - One chapter on climate models and background etc.
    - Latex tips would also be fairly helpful
  - I should be adding references as I go
- Some model datasets dont have dates which is weird

  - Choose a different date if 1960s - 70s is nan
  - Work just 5000 during a smaller time period
  - 5000 windows / averages? weekly average & 10 x 10 of australia or something

- Get some results out
  - The application itself is original but you need to prove that
  - Some interpretation / explainability is needed
    - The first run through eg. the sparse graph
    - Look through the graph explainability part in pyg
- Keep writing & emailing yanan any issues
  - 5-10 pages ideal
  - Dont worry about reading climate stuff too much just yet
