# Friday 19th May Meeting

## Meeting Time: 3pm

## Location: Online (Teams)

# Attendees:

- Yanan Fan
- Justin Clarke

# Agenda:

- Struggling with historical
  - Need a meeting with Nandini or Max to figure out how to get historical in the grid points we want
- GNN Structure in python
  - Currently using 1 ACCESS-CM2 as the truth right now
  - Still working through understanding pytorch
- What does each model stand for
- Which models aren't similar to each other
  - We can optimise on some other criterion like mutual information to see which ensemble of models gives us the most information
    - Essentially asking which models are the most dissimilar
- At some point maybe we can go over the stuff about A and masks with XiongWen
- Is there some way of putting mean to the message passing framework / manipulate it with the prior
  - Can we refine it to make it a measure of correlation / distance to two nodes

# Goals for next week

- Get Xiongwen's code for GNNs and try get GNNs running
- Visualise a smaller number of models with GNNs (around 10)
  - Write down / comment what I've found and been doing
- Read a bit more, try become a bit more of an expert on GNNs and come up with some of your own ideas
  - Read a bit on message passing

# Previous Meeting Updates

- Climate explorer errored out of me so I'm not sure where to proceed with finding the historicals
