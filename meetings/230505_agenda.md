# Goals for next week

# Previous Meeting Updates

- Options
  - For each model, stack all the values into a single column and have the x matrix as a matrix of all models
    - This gives you an overall dependence
  - For each model and variable, have a node representing it.
    - Within each variable, have a fully connected subgraph
      - We could also fully connect all combinations of models and variable (could be messy) option 3
- For grids, stack the time series and grid points into a single vector (flatten)

- Check historical data see if we have the truth or different model stuffs for the Y value (see if we have the truth already)
- Have a go at creating some of the vectors for the neural network
- Have a go at making a first iteration of the GNN
