# Agenda:

- CMIP6 Data

  - Start with something simply
  - Take data over several grids and maybe average from there
  - 5 or 10 grid points (start with daily for now)
  - Start by getting it and formatting it (then plot)
- Xiongwen's Paper (4.2.2)
  - Figure out whether their algorithm is targeting an output and how is it trained
  - We dont know the true connections
  - Do we need to put the true observation as a node to train it on

# Goals for next week

- Get some code and data up and running
- Read through Xiongwens paper again
- Get a meeting with Climate friend to meet and figure out what all the data and website means
- What do nodes represent?
