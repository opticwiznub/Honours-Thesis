# Friday 9th June Meeting

## Meeting Time: 3pm

## Location: Online (Teams)

# Attendees:

- Yanan Fan
- Justin Clarke

# Agenda:

- Problem with GNN code
  - I don't understand how to make the feature vector, how are multiple data entries done with pyg?
- Gaps in my understanding
  - Feature vector (this isn't training data for all observations?)
    - Each node in a graph is usually a feature, not a model.
  - Node Embedding
  - K (projection function) similar for embedding

# Goals for next week

- Find something more concrete to talk about
- Read Introduction to GNNs Liu & Zhou
  - Read the review article after
- Be able to type up all the notation and make it well defined
  - What each X is, what is its dimension,
- Send an email to Xiongwen about to structure the X data, unsure about how it should look
- Upload all the references to the GitHub

# Previous Meeting Updates

- Mathematically write down what I know about the mathematical formation of the model
- Have a look at the basic probabilistic machine learning book.
- Get the code working for next week
- Try get Khanh's thesis to read
