  abstract  = {This article attempts to describe an approach to statistical data analysis which is simultaneously parametric and nonparametric. Given a random sample X 1, …, X n of a random variable X, one would like (1) to test the parametric goodness-of-fit hypothesis H 0 that the true distribution function F is of the form F(x) = F0[(x − μ)/σ)], where F 0 is specified, and (2) when H 0 is not accepted, to estimate nonparametrically the true density-quantile function fQ(u) and score function J(u) = − (fQ)'(u). The article also introduces density-quantile functions, autoregressive density estimation, estimation of location and scale parameters by regression analysis of the sample quantile function, and quantile-box plots.},
  comment   = {Parzen reframes basic statistical concepts in terms of the quantile function and justifies the merits of quantile methods. The main focus of the new research is on exploratory data analysis, and how to use goodness-of-fit tests to assess and suggest parametric models for data. Parzen also discusses an autoregressive approach to goodness-of-fit hypothesis testing, and to density-quantile function estimation. This may be applicable as it introduces complex coeefficients in a Fourier transform. The research develops a specific approach to using quantile functions, however this may not necessarily be the best approach to adapt to complex numbers. Worth revisiting. (28/02)},

  abstract  = {Quantile data analysis and functional statistical inference methods are introduced and applied to provide representations of spectral data which may lead to simple statistical discriminators effective for the estimation of ground truth from satellite spectral measurements. To estimate the ground truth of a pixel, the probability of each possible ground truth is estimated, given observed (estimated) quantile theoretic statistical characteristics of the multispectral image data corresponding to the pixel and its neighboring pixels. A strategy for determining which statistical characteristics discriminate best is described. Results are reported of quantile data analysis of an extensive collection of training files of image data.},
  comment   = {Parzen develops an approach to image data involving calculating the quantile function on a neighbourhood of pixels around the piel to be classified. The characteristics of the quantile function are used to reduce the dimensionality of the data. This idea does not have theoretical grounding, and the use of such a method needs to be carefully justified. It remains to be seen whether this approach is viable in C, as opposed to R^2. (28/02)},
